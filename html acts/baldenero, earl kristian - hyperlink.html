    <p>&nbsp;The future of web-based software architectures is already taking form, 
        and this time it’s server-rendered (again). Papa’s got a brand new bag: HTML-over-Web Sockets 
        and broadcast everything all the time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The dual approach of marrying a Single Page App with an API service has left many 
    dev teams mired in endless JSON wrangling and state discrepancy bugs across two layers. This costs 
    dev time, slows release cycles, and saps the bandwidth for innovation.<br> Excerpts taken from
